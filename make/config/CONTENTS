This directory contains default versions of configuration files and
fragments of configuration files that the pscfpp/setup script 
concatenates and/or copies to appropriate locations in the standard 
build directories (src/ and bld/) to create the config.mk files used 
during compilation. Users may modify the resulting files that are 
installed in the src/ and bld/ directories in order to adapt the 
build system to a particular computer, but should avoid modifying 
the files stored in this directory.

Main makefile in src/ and bld/:

The files main_config.1 and main_config.2 are fragments of the main
configuration file. These two files are concatenated with a compiler 
setup file from the make/compiler directory to create the main 
config.mk configuration file that is installed in the src/ and bld/ 
directories.

The file main_config.1 contains placeholder values for the path ROOT_DIR 
to the main pscfpp and a path BLD_DIR to a particular build directory 
(i.e., to the bld/ or src/ directory). The setup script must be called 
from the root pscfpp/ directory, and replaces these placeholders by the 
actual absolute paths to the relevant directories.

Namespace level makefiles:

The files util_config, pscf_config, fd1d_config, pspc_config and 
pspg_config are repository versions of namespace level configuration 
files. The setup script copies these files unalterted to create files 
named config.mk in each corresponding namespace level subdirectory of
the bld/ and src/ directories.

File paths.h :

The setup script copies a modified version of the file file paths.h 
into the directory pscfpp/src/pscf . This file contains placeholders 
for paths to pscfpp/data and pscfpp/examples directories that the setup 
file replaces with corresponding absolute paths in the installed version.
The path to the data directory is used by the function makeGroupFileName
to construct appropriate paths for files that contain symmetry operations 
for specific space groups.
