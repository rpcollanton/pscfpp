The input files for pscf_pcNd and pscf_pgNd use a standard format to 
specify crystal systems types and unit cell parameters for periodic
structures. The data required to describe a Bravai lattice is input
on a single line with the general format
\code
    latticeSystem   p[0] ... p[N-1]
\endcode
in which latticeSystem denotes a string that identifies a particular
a crystallographic lattice system (e.g., cubic, orthorhombic, etc) 
and p[0] .... p[N-1] indicates a list of N parameters required to 
specify the lengths and relative angles of the basis vectors for a 
lattice of that type.  The number N of parameters required to fully
describe the unit cell is different for different lattice systems.
For example, a 3D cubic lattice can be specified by giving a single
parameter, which is the length of any of the three orthogonal basis
vectors, whereas 6 parameters are required to describe a 3D triclinic
lattice.  

Because the pscf package requires the user to use different programs 
to simulate systems of different dimensionality, it is not necessary 
for this data format explicitly specify the dimensionality D of space. 
The value of D is known from which program is being used. The list of 
allowed lattice system identifiers is different for systems that are
periodic in 1, 2, or 3 spatial dimensions.

<h3> 1D Systems </h3>

There is only possible Bravais lattice for a one dimensionally periodic
system, which is referred to here as "lamellar". A 1D lamellar system
only has one lattice parameter, which is the repeat distance along the
direction in which the system is periodic, denoted here by d.
The text representation of a unit cell for a lamellar phase with lattice 
spacing of d = 5.6 in the chosen system of units would thus be
\code
    lamellar  5.6 
\endcode

<h3> 2D Systems </h3>
There are 4 conventional 2D lattice systems (square, hexagonal, rectangular,
and oblique). The pscf code also allows the user to specify a "rhombic"
unit cell, which is an oblique unit cell in which the two basis vectors
have equal magnitude. 

The names of the lattice systems, and the list of parameter required by
each is listed below. Throughout, let a and b denote the lengths of the
lattice basis vectors, and let alpha denote the angle between these two
vectors. When a value for the parameter alpha is required, it must be 
provided in radians, and not in degrees.

<h3> 3D Systems </h3>

In what follows we use the letters a, b, c both to denote lengths of the three basis vectors and as labels to identify the actual vectors.
Different definitions of angles are used for different lattice systems, as
discussed below:
