A Pscf::Pspc::Solvent < D > object represents a solvent species. 
Each solvent molecule is a point-like particle that has an associated monomer type and a size. The size corresponds to the solvent volume, expressed as a
ratio of the actual volume to a monomer reference volume.

The parameter file block associated with such a Solvent has the format:

\code
Solvent{
  monomerId  int
  size       float
  phi*       float 
  mu*        float
}
\endcode
Here, as elsewhere, labels followed by an asterisk (*) represent optional parameters or sub-blocks.
Individual parameters that appear in this format are described below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td> monomerid </td>
    <td> 
    Integer monomer type index
    Type of polymer topology, allowed values "linear" or "branched". 
    This optional variable is set to "linear" by default. 
    The underlying variable is an enumeration of type Pscf::SolventType::Enum.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> size </td>
    <td> 
    Solvent size, expressed as a ratio of the actual volume per molecule to the monomer referece volume. 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> phi* </td>
    <td> Overall volume fraction for this solvent species.
         A value of either phi or mu must be provided, but not both. 
    </td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> mu* </td>
    <td> Chemical potential for this solvent species.
         A value of either phi or mu must be provided, but not both. 
    </td> 
  </tr>
</table>
