A Pscf::UnitCell<D> object represents a crystallographic unit cell in a D dimensional crystal.

\sa Pscf::UnitCell
\sa Pscf::UnitCell<1>
\sa Pscf::UnitCell<2>
\sa Pscf::UnitCell<3>

The data required to describe a UnitCell<D> object can be read from and written to C++ iostreams using overloaded insertion and extraction operators. 
The text representation generally contains a string that identifies a crystal lattice system (i.e., a unit cell type), followed by a list of unit cell parameters.
The number and type of required parameters depends on the dimensionality of space D (which is a class template parameter) and the declared lattice system.

For example, in a simulation of a 3D crystal, the text
\code
   cubic 3.68
\endcode
indicates that the Bravais lattice has a cubic unit cell with a single unit cell parameter with a value of 3.68, which represents the length of any edge of a simple-cubic unit cell along any of three orthogonal primary directions.
